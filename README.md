# Basic Algorithms and Data Structures - in Java
This repository contains the Java implementation of some well-known data structures and algorithms.
I implemented these during my student years for fun. Maybe someone can benefit from it! 
Almost all implementations have their own main function and can be run separately.

Where possible, I also noted the time complexity of the algorithms.

## Algorithms
* Adding Large Numbers Using Stacks
* Bellman Ford Algorithm:
    * Implementation using Edges
    * Implementation using Vertices
* Binary Search 
* Delimiter Matching
* Dijkstra Algorithm
* Fibonacci:
    * Recursive Implementation
    * Iterative Implementation
* Topological Sort 
* Shortest Path Algorithm Using a Topological Sort
* Word Permutation Algorithm
* Sorting Algorithms:
    * Bubble Sort
    * Insertion Sort
    * Selection Sort
    * Heap Sort
    * Merge Sort
    * Quick Sort
    * Shell Sort
* Number Base Transformation

## Data Structures
* Array-Based Heap
* Doubly-Linked List
* Single-Linked List
* Circular Queue
* Dynamic Stack
* Static Stack
* Binary Tree
